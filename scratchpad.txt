Mesh routing:
    - Ever so often, less often then heartbeat, share N hop neighbor table
    - Share this neighbor table to immediate neighbors
    - If the receiving node thinks it makes sense to update the entry or add an entry from the neighbor table
        - the next hop for the given dest will be the author of the neighbor table sharing

Testing:
    - Send data to random nodes and trace the path
