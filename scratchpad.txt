The behavior of a registered node should be that if we hear a join request, we make that requested node a CH, reg node becomes a router

Assumptions:
- routers stay as registered nodes to their originating cluster
Ongoing metrics:
- base implementation makes 56 clusters, lets try to minimize this

Things to measure for final report:
- the more we grow the mesh table, how much more mesh routing do we see?

State 12:20PM - 11/23: number of clusters made is now 38 instead of 56, so we see improvement here!

Next steps:
- recovery and mantenence
- visualization of packets
- metrics
- optimization using tx range variation
