The behavior of a registered node should be that if we hear a join request, we make that requested node a CH, reg node becomes a router

Assumptions:
- routers stay as registered nodes to their originating cluster
Ongoing metrics:
- base implementation makes 56 clusters, lets try to minimize this

Things to measure for final report:
- the more we grow the mesh table, how much more mesh routing do we see?
-
