1. Mesh routing
    - neighbor table share to immediate neighbors
    - test with peer to peer data tx


Hop count currently stored as the number of hops to the root node.

We want a hop count that is distance from neighbor
neighbor_hop_count we add this to the heartbeat response as those are our closest neighbors
Next hop for mesh is not done correctly, it's currently the node in question
color code different type of messages (table share = purple for example)


To measure tx delay timestamp - prop delay and on recv

Tx power, each ch has tx power, once node joins, gets that tx power same as rest of cluster

To resolve loss, need to add watchdog timers to our critical messages

Okay so clusters are created correctly but node id's in the network are still tied to the unique id

we might want to expand the logic for every packet sent on the network, not just routing
